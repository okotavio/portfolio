I decided to start my discovery with three steps which included qualitative research with tenants, inspectors and a workshop with stakeholders:

1. In-depth interviews: scripted, 30-minute calls with 10 tenants who had recently moved in.

1. Contextual inquiries: observing and interviewing three professional inspectors while they inspected real properties.

1. CSD workshop: a series of workshops to gather information from stakeholders and operational teams through "certainties, assumptions and doubts" (CSD) on the inspection process.

These steps allowed me and my team to understand:

1. What was a professional inspector's mental model while inspecting a property so as to bring a similar model for tenants.

1. What were tenants' pain points with the move-in inspection and how we could empower them with a self-service application.

After I gathered enough information on inspections, I kicked off the solution with an ideation workshop so as to bring other product designers and make it a collaborative process.

This allowed me to quickly have a few ideas to prototype a solution, bring it to a design critique and test it with users within a week and a half. At the end, my process involved the following steps:

1. Design jam: a 2-hour workshop with 7 product designers going through How Might We, Crazy 8s and other ideation exercises.

1. Design critique: a 1-hour critique session to gather feedback from other product designers on design system usage, writing and accessibility.

1. Usability testing: a task-based usability test with 5 recruited users to test our solution out.
